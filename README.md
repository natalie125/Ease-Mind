The project consists of a platform developed collaboratively by myself and other students, with the EaseMind app being my individual contribution. The conbribution table is available in the Larks Wiki (2023).

The EaseMind app is a mental health support application designed to help individuals with anxiety through early diagnosis and continuous support. Using machine learning and artificial intelligence, it assesses users' anxiety levels and offers a chatbot for real-time interaction. Key features include anxiety assessment questionnaires, daily monitoring through a questionnaire, and an AI chatbot that provides personalised mental health resources. The app can detect potential risks related to self-harm or suicidal thoughts and advise users to seek professional help when necessary. This project is aimed to create a supportive platform, provides a private and accessible space for users to monitor and manage their mental well-beingâ€‹.
